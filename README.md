For this project I have created you are asked to guess a letter for the secret word. If you guess the letter correctly you will see the letter displayed for you. Also you have attempts set for the length of the secret word you are given. Your attempts will not be counted if you guess the same letter but will go down if you guess incorrectly. You will be prompted if you run out of attempts and the same if you win.
